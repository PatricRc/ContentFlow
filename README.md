## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Integration & API Key

*   The AI features are powered by the Google Gemini API.
*   You **must** provide your own API key in the Settings to use these features.
*   The application makes direct calls from your browser to the Gemini API.
*   **Important Security Note:** Storing API keys in browser `localStorage` is **not secure** and can be accessed by browser extensions or XSS attacks. This application is intended for personal use or with API keys that have limited permissions and a short lifecycle. **Use this feature at your own risk.**

## üéÆ Gamification

*   **Points:** Earned for completing steps and entire content pieces.
*   **Levels:** Progress through levels as you accumulate points.
*   **Streaks:** Maintain a daily streak by completing at least one task.

## üíæ Data Storage

*   All your data, including content pieces, user statistics, achievements, API key, and theme preference, is stored locally in your web browser's `localStorage`.
*   This means your data is persistent on the browser you use it on, but it won't sync across different browsers or devices.
*   Clearing your browser's `localStorage` for this site will erase all your data.

## üå± Future Enhancements

*   User authentication and cloud data storage for cross-device access.
*   More advanced AI features and model integrations.
*   Customizable workflow templates.
*   Calendar integration for content scheduling.
